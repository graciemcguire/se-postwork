# Building your Personal Portfolio Site

In addition to upgrading and polishing your portfolio projects, building a personal website is a great way to both build your online presence and show off your abilities as a web developer.

### Building Your Site

The Career Prep track already includes a detailed lesson on what you can include on your website, so we recommend <a href="https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/careers-personal-website-portfolio" target="_blank">reading through the suggestions there</a> to get an idea of what content your site should include. Also, be sure to review the <a href="https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/careers-personal-brand-building" target="_blank">lesson on personal brand building</a> to help you think about how your site should represent you.

You are free to develop your personal website however you choose - if you'd like to build one using a a site like WordPress or Wix, feel free to. However, you do have all the skills required to create one entirely from scratch, and doing this will give you a greater degree of control over exactly how your site looks and functions. You might consider building a site based on what sort of roles you're looking to apply for - particularly, if you are going to be applying for frontend or full-stack development roles, building a nicely polished frontend in React or JavaScript/HTML can be an additional opportunity to showcase your abilities beyond your portfolio projects.

A few professional tools to look into for building a portfolio site that will also give you more practice with React are:

- <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>
- <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a>

Your personal website does not have to be very fancy. Many professional developers actually opt for a minimal approach to their personal website. One important thing to keep in mind, though - make sure your site looks good on multiple devices, not just your personal computer. It is entirely possible a company recruiter might look at your site using their phone, especially if you've linked to it from your LinkedIn profile.

### Deploying Your Site

Custom built personal sites are typically static, so you probably don't need a backend. Because of this, hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub pages</a> is a good option to consider as your site will probably already be stored on your GitHub account. For deploying React sites, we recommend the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages" target="_blank">gh-pages</a> NPM package, as it streamlines the process of pushing up changes. 

If your portfolio site uses React, we recommend Netlify. Check out <a href="https://www.netlify.com/with/react/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> for how to deploy. 

### Getting a Domain Name

You aren't required to get a domain for your personal site, but it can be helpful as part of building your personal brand. For example, you might have a GitHub account name that isn't recognizable as you, so hosting your personal website at `<your-cool-username>.github.io` may not be ideal. Having a custom domain name gives you the option to publicize something more direct, like `<your-full-name>.com`.

There are many domain registration services available online. <a href="https://domains.google/" target="_blank">Google Domains</a>, for instance, offers domain registration options for less than $20 a year and includes documentation on how to redirect from your custom domain to where your site is hosted. __Be careful to explore what options are available before locking in a domain name, though.__ You do not want to register a domain for a year, only to realize shortly after you'd rather use a different service or different name.
