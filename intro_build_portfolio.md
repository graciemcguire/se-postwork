# Build a 5 Star Portfolio

Throughout your time at Flatiron School, you have completed a ton of awesome projects! Now it's time to go back and fix up those last features you didn't get to, clean up your code, and make them ready to show off to employers. A good portfolio typically has 3 projects that the developer is thoroughly familiar with. You should be ready to discuss all the ins and outs of your projects, and a good way to reacquaint yourself with them is to go back and upgrade them! 

Once you have your projects ready, it's time to build your portfolio site! A portfolio site is a great way to show off your projects, while also showing your personality. Remember, companies don't want to hire someone just because they can code, they want to hire people _they want to work with!_ 

By the end of this section, you should have:

* Upgraded your Capstone project, and made it portfolio ready
* Chosen 2 of your other projects to upgrade and make portfolio ready
* Built a personal portfolio site
