# Flatiron's Data Structure and Algorithm Course

Welcome to our Data Structures and Algorithms (DS&A) course! Preparing for technical interviews means improving your understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms so you can approach whiteboarding interviews with confidence.

This course is structured so that you can work on new problems daily and level up your skills over time.

All of the course material is available on GitHub:

[Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/postwork-data-structures-and-algorithms/)

The course consists of the following:

* Tips for preparing for technical interviews
* Daily exercises, starting with easier problems and gradually building in complexity
* Instructions on how to collaborate with fellow alumni on whiteboarding exercises
* Common DS&A topics, like recursion, Big O notation, Tree traversal and Graph traversal

You'll need to fork and clone the course so that you can work on it locally. Check out the [README](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/postwork-data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/README.md) for the course on GitHub for more information, and good luck!
