# Mock Technical Interview

Good News! Flatiron provides you with an incredible opportunity to have a trial
mock technical interview. You will soon receive an email from SkilledInc
(hello@skilledinc.com), a partner we work with who will conduct your Mock
Technical Interview.

This email will provide instructions to redeem your scheduling ‘token,’ and book
your interview. (Loom video with sign-up instructions
[here](https://www.loom.com/share/8b3090674354443e8b27c3871d0c20fb).)

Treat this interview as you would a meeting with an actual employer — you must
attend your scheduled time. If you do not attend your interview, or do not
cancel/reschedule within the required time, they will consider you a “no show”
and you will forfeit your mock interview opportunity.

After your Mock Technical is complete, please
[share your interview feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dWu1Nezu3TyLjcxY7RV1Hr54KD01j491WlbostxV_30/edit)!
