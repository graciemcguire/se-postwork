# Practicing Technical Interviewing

Once you've worked through some of the technical algorithm problems, it's time to practice your interview communication skills.

The number 1 thing to remember about tech interviewing is that it takes practice! No one is going to nail it on the first try, so it's good to get as much practice in as possible!

We're sharing below the step-by-step process that fabulous coach Ben Lappen gives his students to help them prepare for mock tech interviews.

Hey fellow Students, 

The biggest issue we see our students struggle with during whiteboarding challenges (solving a problem live in front of an interviewer) is communication. 

We see many students _mumble code._ Mumble code is when you talk under your breath and code fast but the interviewer does not know what you're doing. Instead, here's how to achieve a 'consultative style' for these whiteboarding challenges:

a) Repeat the problem back to the interviewer.

b) Confirm edge cases (issues that the interviewer wants you to look out for in the code).

c) Break the algorithm problem into smaller parts and discuss those with the interviewer. Invite a back and forth where you propose solutions and gauge buy-in.

d) As you code, talk out loud. Tell the interviewer what you hope each line of code will do as you write it.

e) Finally, when the solution is complete, ask for feedback and make it clear you're eager to collaborate.

Don't underestimate how valuable good communication is to winning the technical interview, especially for junior developers. One former student (now employed) recently told me about a new developer whose job is in jeopardy - the reason: poor communication. Companies look for developers who are collaborators and communicators. This is your time to practice! Use the [free Loom video](https://www.loom.com/) software to record yourself from beginning to end without stopping.  Review, make notes, modify, and re-record. You won't regret the time you took to practice this important skill.
