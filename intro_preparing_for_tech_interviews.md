# Preparing for Tech Interviews

Throughout your time at Flatiron School, you completed a ton of awesome projects! Now it's time to go back and fix up those last features you didn't get to, clean up your code, and make them ready to show off to employers. A good portfolio typically has 3 projects that the developer knows all the ins and outs to. You should be ready to discuss all the ins and outs of your projects, and a good way to reaquaint yourself with them is to go back and upgrade them! 

By the end of this section, you should have:

* Completed the Flatiron Data Structures and Algorithm Course
* Signed up for your Mock Technical interview
