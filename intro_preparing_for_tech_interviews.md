# Preparing for Tech Interviews

You've spent your time at Flatiron learning a ton of different stuff. Unfortunately, it's hard to showcase all that a developer knows in the short time companies have to interview applicants. For this reason, a lot of companies will give developers Data Structure and Algorithm code challenges to test an applicants knowledge, problem solving skills, and style. 

Once you have your projects ready, it's time to build your portfolio site! A portfolio site is a great way to show off your projects, while also showing your personality. Remember, companies don't want to hire someone just because they can code, they want to hire people _they want to work with!_ 

By the end of this section, you should have:

* Completed the Data Structures and Algorithm Course
* Signed up for a Mock Technical Interview
