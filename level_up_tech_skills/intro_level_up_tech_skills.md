# Leveling up Your Tech Skills

So far in your software engineering career you have learned abuot `Git`, `JavaScript`, `React`, `Ruby`, `Rails`, `SQL`, `CSS`, and more! The best way to keep these skills sharp is to keep building upon what you have already learned. Actively learning more and expanding your tech knowledge is also a great way to show employers that you have an _always learning_ (@liz - whats the flatiron goal about this? i forget lolz) mindset, which is exactly what they want in a developer! Once you have completed each of the following tasks (maybe not the right word?) make sure to add your new skill to your LinkedIn and resume! As a bonus, write a blog about your new skill to show your future employers that you really know what your talking about, and to help other developers in the future!
