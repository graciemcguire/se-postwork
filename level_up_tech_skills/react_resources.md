# React Resources

Being a React developer means not only mastering React itself, but also getting comfortable with the ecosystem around React and exploring other tools that work alongside it. This list of tools will help you build out or refactor your existing React projects, or build projects in a new way.

Start by revisiting the <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React documentation</a> now that you have more experience with React. Explore the advanced topics in particular. Check out the blog as well for updates on new features coming to React.

## Build your own React

## Beyond Create React App: Next.js and Gatsby

In addition to Create React App, there are a couple other very popular tools for generating new React projects that come with a different set of features.

<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a> is a static site generator that helps build lightning-fast sites by generating HTML from your React components at build time. It's a popular choice for blogs and portfolio sites thanks to a large amount of community-built themes and plugins. If you're planning on building your own personal site for blogs and portfolio pieces, learning Gatsby is a great way to go.

<a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a> is a React framework that is capable of static site generation as well as server-side rendering. It's popular because it comes more "batteries included" than other React tools, and handles routing nicely. If you need more features than Gatsby has to offer, Next.js is another great tool to try out.

## CSS in JS

The idea of modularization and creating components in React has led to an entirely new way of thinking about CSS in React applications.

Check out a library like <a href="https://styled-components.com/" target="_blank">styled-components</a> (this <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/styling-react-applications-with-styled-components-8834" target="_blank">free course on Egghead</a> is a nice intro), and try to refactor a project to use this library.

## Testing React Applications

Many companies implement tests in their React codebases to ensure that adding new features doesn't cause issues and give confidence that all new code added to the codebase works.

There are two popular libraries to learn when it comes to testing in React:

- <a href="https://jestjs.io/" target="_blank">Jest</a> is a testing framework that lets you run tests from the command line and write assertions about your code
- <a href="https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/" target="_blank">React Testing Library</a> works with Jest to write tests specifically for your React components

Both of these tools are already installed with Create React App, so you can start adding tests to your projects without installing anything new! Check out <a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-library" target="_blank">this blog for a good tutorial to get started</a>.

## Modern Redux

Redux has changed quite a bit over the years! The official Redux tutorials are kept up to date with the latest recommendations from the Redux team about how to use Redux the right way.

Follow the <a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts" target="_blank">Redux Essentials</a> guide, and build out the demo app. Then, try building a new small project from scratch using Redux.
