## CSS Diner

Selectors are the 'nouns' of CSS. They let you choose which elements on the page to style. While you can always try to add classes and ids to elements to make selecting them easier, sometimes you want more sophisticated targeting.

Practice your selectors with <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/" target="_blank">CSS Diner</a>. The exercises should take you about 30 minutes of focused time.

## Visual Mess

Before reading, try to answer these questions.

- What is a 'clean' design?
- What are the goals of the design of a page?

What does 'clean' even mean? As engineers, we are constantly caching out our intuitions and hunches into concrete statements, predictions, and code. Read <a href="http://www.visualmess.com/" target="_blank">Clean Up Your Mess: A Guide To Visual Design For Everyone</a> to learn about the principles of visual design and the levers that you have for making your designs 'clean'.

After reading, answer the following questions.

- Revisit your answers to the pre-check questions. What updates would you make based on what you read?
- What are the tools you can use to make designs more 'clean'?

## CSS Grid

Positioning and layout are among the most common and difficult problems in CSS. Grid offers a powerful and (eventually) intuitive system for laying out elements on the page.

Practice using CSS Grid with the exercises in <a href="http://cssgridgarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Grid Garden</a>. There are 28 mini exercises, and they should take about 30 minutes of focused time to complete.

You can also check out this free course from Wes Bos on <a href="https://cssgrid.io/" target="_blank">CSS Grid</a> for additional practice.

## CSS Flexbox

Laying out elements so that they fit and float to fill space in ways that feel 'right' on screens of different sizes is a major challenge in CSS. Flexbox is a syntax for choosing how elements will flow inside their parent.

Practice using Flexbox with <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/" target="_blank">Flexbox Froggy</a>. The 24 exercises should take about half an hour.

## Can't Unsee

Design mistakes are everywhere. Once you start to see them, you'll never be able to _stop_ seeing them. This is good.

<a href="https://cantunsee.space/" target="_blank">Can't Unsee</a> has dozens of tiny examples of design errors. You get to practice seeing them. It's like a game, where the prize is an eternity of noticing the design flaws in applications everywhere, forever.

Good luck.

## Learn Enough CSS to be Dangerous

<a href="https://www.learnenough.com/css-and-layout-tutorial/introduction" target="_blank">Learn Enough CSS to be Dangerous</a> guides you through the foundations of CSS. Since you've already practiced some of the fundamentals of CSS, some of this will be review. That should free up some of your mental space to focus on the deeper details - how the browser lays out components, how to handle mobile views and media queries, and how to build common layouts using the tools you know.

Reading the guide and completing the exercises should take about 5 hours.
